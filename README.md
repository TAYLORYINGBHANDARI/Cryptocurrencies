# Cryptocurrencies
# About
A prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
Use the unsupervised learning,clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies.
Share the finding with data visualizations 

# Tasks
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Using your knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, you’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Using knowledge of the K-means algorithm, you’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, you’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
Using your knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, you’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components you created in Deliverable 2, then you’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
